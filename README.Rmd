# `assurance`

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

An R package for implementing the assurance method for normally distributed data, with elicited distributions for the treatment effect, and the population variances in the treatment and control arms. 

## Installation

The `assurance` package is currently on GitHub only, and requires the development version of `SHELF` (also on GitHub only). Install these with the commands

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("OakleyJ/SHELF")
devtools::install_github("OakleyJ/assurance")
```

## Example 

This code illustrates the example from Alhussein and Oakley (2019).

We suppose the expert judges 
$$Pr(\delta = 0) = 0.5,$$ and conditional on $\delta \neq 0$, the expert judges
$$
Pr(\delta \le 0.25|\delta \neq 0) = 0.25,
$$
$$
Pr(\delta \le 0.4|\delta \neq 0) = 0.5, 
$$
$$
Pr(\delta \le 0.55|\delta \neq 0) = 0.75. 
$$

We fit a distribution to these judgements with the command

```{r, message = FALSE}
v <- c(0.25, 0.4, 0.55)
p <- c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)
myfitDelta <- SHELF::fitdist(vals = v, probs = p)
```

We suppose that a response of at least 0.2 is required for a patient to benefit. We suppose that if treatment effect were $\delta = 0.4$, expert judges between 60% and 80% of patients would benefit.

```{r}
myfitTau <- SHELF::fitprecision(c(-Inf, 0.2),
                                propvals = c(0.2, 0.4),
                                propprobs = c(0.05, 0.95),
                                med = 0.4)
```

We now estimate the assurance, for sample sizes of 20 patients per group:


```{r}
assurance::assuranceNormal(fitDelta = myfitDelta,
                fitPrecisionTmt = myfitTau,
                pDeltaZero  = 0.5,
                nTreatment = 20,
                nControl = 20)
```

Next, we consider the information that might result from observing 10 patients in each arm. Denoting these 20 observations by $D$, we consider the predictive distribution of 

$$
Pr(\delta > 0 | D),
$$
as a function of the yet-to-be-observed data $D$. The following command will simulate 1000 trials, and estimate the probability of a positive treatment effect given the data from each trial.

```{r}
pEffective <- assurance::sampleInterim(fitDelta = myfitDelta,
                                       fitPrecisionTmt = myfitTau,
                                       nControl = 10,
                                       nTreatment = 10,
                                       pDeltaZero = 0.5,
                                       nTrials = 1000)
```

We would like 
$$
Pr(\delta > 0 | D),
$$
to be close to 0 or 1. We count the proportion of the 1000 trials in which this probability is either less than 0.05, or greater than 0.95:

```{r}
mean(pEffective < 0.05 | pEffective > 0.95)
```

We display the predictive distribution of posterior probabilities with a histogram:

```{r}
hist(pEffective, breaks = seq(from = 0, 
                              to = 1, 
                              by = 0.05),
     xlab = expression(P(delta>=0~"| trial data")),
     main ="")
```

## `shiny` app  

A `shiny` app is included in the package for implementing all the above methods. To launch the app, run the command

```{r, eval = FALSE}
assuranceNormalApp()
```
